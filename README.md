# Energy-Management-Model
## Overview

The Energy Management Model is a comprehensive simulation tool designed for optimising energy utilisation in motorsport events. By modelling energy consumption rates, regeneration capabilities, and lap performance, this tool enables teams to develop efficient strategies for completing races within energy constraints.

## Features

- **Energy Consumption Modelling**: Simulates energy usage based on lap times and driving style.
- **Regeneration Analysis**: Evaluates energy recovery through regenerative braking.
- **Strategy Optimisation**: Suggests optimal lap speeds and energy allocations.
- **Scenario Simulations**: Models performance under varying track and weather conditions.
- **Visualisation Tools**: Provides detailed plots of energy usage, regeneration, and lap performance.
